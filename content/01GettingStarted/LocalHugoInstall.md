{{% notice tip %}} Hugo is installed on the container so it's best to use it there.  These instructions are included for legacy learning purposes {{% /notice %}}

### Hugo Local install 

- If you're using a Mac, run the following brew install from your terminal

    ```sh
    brew install hugo 
    ```
    
    If you're using Windows, install chocolatey for windows ([follow directions here](https://chocolatey.org/install)).  Once installed run the following
    
    ```sh
    choco install hugo -confirm
    ```

- Run Hugo webserver locally to see a local version of the rendered website

    From within the root of the repo you copied onto your system
    
    ```sh
    hugo server
    ```

- Click on the URL presented after the above command finishes to view a local version of your first Hugo formatted website

### Clone Central Repo if not using a container
- Because you're not using a contianer, you need to clone and maintain fresh copy of [CentralRepo](https://github.com/FortinetCloudCSE/CentralRepo)
    ```shell
        git clone https://github.com/FortinetCloudCSE/CentralRepo.git --recursive LocalCopyCentralRepo          
    ```
- To pull updates later
    ```shell
        cd LocalCopyCentralRepo
        git pull -r    
    ```

### Running Hugo locally w/ CentralRepo + UserRepo
- Start in Central Repo, and use hugo webserver, pointing to proper content directory and config files
    ```shell
      cd LocalCopyCentralRepo 
      hugo server --contentDir $(PWD)/../UserRepo/content --config $(PWD)/../UserRepo/config.toml -p 8080
    ```
  - Flags:
    - '--contentDir': tell Hugo where the /content folder is
    - '--config': tell Hugo where the frontmatter config file is
    - '-p': tell Hugo webserver what port to use
  - Hugo will serve up a local version of the page at: [http://localhost:8080/UserRepo/](http://localhost:8080/UserRepo/)

- Now that you have Hugo running locally, you can proceed to [content creation with Hugo](../02hugo.html)

- When you're ready to perform a final 'hugo build' on your site, be sure to use the '-d' flag to write files back into your UserRepo
```shell
  hugo --minify -d $(PWD)/../UserRepo/docs --contentDir $(PWD)/../UserRepo/content --config $(PWD)/../UserRepo/config.toml --cleanDestinationDir
```
