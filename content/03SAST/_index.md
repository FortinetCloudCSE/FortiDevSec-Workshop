### Running SAST Scans Locally (25 minutes)

In this chapter, you'll set up a FortiDevSec application in the console, integrate it with JIRA, and issue the Docker command to run a SAST scan manually at the command line. You'll then view the results both in the console and in JIRA and observe how updates to your JIRA workflow propagate back to FortiDevSec.
