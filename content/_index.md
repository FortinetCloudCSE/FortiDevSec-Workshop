### Welcome!

The realm of application security involves tools and techniques to protect applications from attacks and violations. Due to the huge advancement in hacking techniques and cyber-attack methodologies even modern complex applications contain unassessed security risks and vulnerabilities that may lead to substantial harm to your organization/business. Evaluating the security risks associated with applications and assessing the security weaknesses allows you to mitigate the potential risk to your organization with appropriate remedial measures.

FortiDevSec is a cloud-based automated application security tool that performs intensive and comprehensive scans for an accurate vulnerability assessment of your application.

The purpose of this TEChnical Recipe is to familiarize the learner with FortiDevSec, the various types of vulnerabilities it can help identify and remediate, and the ways in which it may be integrated into DevSecOps pipelines to enable such identification and remediation during and before deployment.

### Learning Objectives
- Set up the Github repository and configure a FortiDevSec application
- Run a SAST scan locally on the vulnerable application
- Run a DAST scan locally on the vulnerable application
- Understand FortiDevSec integration with JIRA
