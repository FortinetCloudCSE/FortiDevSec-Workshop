### What is Hugo and how easy can this be?

- The site you are viewing right now is built with Hugo.
- You can navigate to specific chapters and tasks with the Left Navbar or the top banner table of contents
  - For a sequential step by step flow through this workshop, use the arrows in the upper right corner to go through each step individually

### Development Environment Options

- To start, you'll [request a new repo which is a clone of User Repo](01gettingstarted/userrepo.html).
  - you'll create the content for your TECWorkshop guides in this repo, and ultimately publish the Hugo built website to GitHub Pages
- Once you have UserRepo, you can choose how to use Hugo 


1. [Option 1](01gettingstarted/containerbuild.html): build a container with Hugo installed on it and a copy of all Fortinet specific customizations to the Hugo reLearn theme 
   - Beyond providing an opportunity to learn the basics of container development, this option:
      - streamlines and simplifies the Hugo content creation process
      - minimizes local storage/upkeep of reusable componentry
      - reduces complications of version dependencies in devlopment environment for Hugo or the reLearn theme
      - future-proofs the content created for any given TECWorkshop so that any Fortinet branding changes can be easily re-applied to all guides
2. [Option 2](01gettingstarted/localhugoinstall.html): Install Hugo locally on your laptop/workstation and clone CentralRepo
   - You'll have to 
     - maintain CentralRepo including submodules on your local workstation
     - ensure your final site is published to the /docs folder in your UserRepo
