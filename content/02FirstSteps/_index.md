### Application Setup and Launch (45 minutes)

In this chapter, you’ll clone a sample GitHub repository locally and edit the fdevsec.yaml configuration file, launch a GitHub Actions runner associated with the repo, and deploy the application with the runner, all in preparation for the scans you’ll run in sections 2 and 3. You’ll also set up a JIRA Bug-tracking project and integrate it with FortiDevSec.
