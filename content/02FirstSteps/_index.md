### Application Setup and Launch (45 minutes)

In this chapter, you’ll clone a popular GitHub repository locally, configure a FortiDevSec scan and integrate the fdevsec.yaml configuration file, launch a GitHub Actions runner for the application and then deploy with it, all in preparation for the scans you’ll run in later chapters. You’ll also set up a JIRA Bug-tracking project and integrate it with FortiDevSec.
