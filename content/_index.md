### Welcome!

This site will explain how to use the [Hugo Web Framework]("https://gohugo.io/") & the ["reLearn" Theme]("https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/index.html") to effectively organize & deliver Fortinet TEC Workshops & Product demos in a consistent, simple, and visually appealing format.

The beauty of this framework lies in its simplicity.  Within approx 30 mins, anybody can have a site up and running.  Content is created via Markdown files, and the workshop guide layout is simply a directory structure.

Follow along on this simple tutorial to get up and running with a Hugo formatted site for your TEC Workshop/training/demo content today!
