### Create GitHub action for Hugo Publish 

{{% notice warning %}}  You must have proper repo permissions to setup a GitHub action.  If you do not see the settings button on the top repo banner/ribbon, please reach out to the repo owner to get the proper permissions {{% /notice%}}

1. In your web browser, navigate to the GitHub repo and click on **Settings** in the top ribbon 
![repoSettings](repoSettings.png)
2. On the left hand nav bar, click on **Pages**
![repoPages](repoPages.png)
3. Under **Source** select **GitHub Actions**
![pages-deployAction](pages-deployAction.png)
4. Click **Browse All Workflows**
![pages-browseWorkflows](pages-browseWorkflows.png)
5. Search for **Hugo** and then click **Configure** under the Hugo GitHub Actions
![pages-workflowHugo](pages-workflowHugo.png)
6. You'll see a hugo.yml file created, which directs GitHubActions to execute a Hugo Build Command anytime the repo is updated.  We need to make 1 minor adjustment to this file.  B/c we located our hugo content underneath the repo root, we need to tell hugo where it needs to build and publish. Once updated per your folder naming in the spots shown below, click **Start Commit**

Specifically, you want to add a **working-directory** under the **jobs: --> build: --> steps: section** and then update the **Upload Artifact** path.  You can copy and paste this entire script into your hugo.yml file, or just edit the specific lines for working directory (in the bottom 1/3 of the file)
