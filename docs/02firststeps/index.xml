First, download the template and parameter file:
cd ~/AWSGoat wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortinetCloudCSE/FortiDevSec-Workshop/main/cloudformation/github-actions/launch-runner-ec2.yml wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortinetCloudCSE/FortiDevSec-Workshop/main/cloudformation/github-actions/launch-runner-params.json General instructions for setting up a runner with these CloudFormation templates may be found here, or you may continue to follow along here.
In order to deploy the runner, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to fill in several pieces of information in the parameter file launch-runner-params.</description></item><item><title>Application Launch</title><link>https://fortinetcloudcse.github.io/FortiDevSec-Workshop/02firststeps/applicationlaunch.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fortinetcloudcse.github.io/FortiDevSec-Workshop/02firststeps/applicationlaunch.html</guid><description>Application Launch For this task, you will utilize the Github Actions runner created in a previous step to deploy a Terraform stack. The stack will contain several resources as part of a vulnerable web application reachable from the public internet. The URL can then be supplied to FortiDevSec to run a DAST scan.
As a reminder, to complete this part of the lab, you will need an AWS User Access Key with Administrative permissions Terraform will need to create resources in your account.</description></item><item><title>JIRA Setup</title><link>https://fortinetcloudcse.github.io/FortiDevSec-Workshop/02firststeps/setupjira.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fortinetcloudcse.github.io/FortiDevSec-Workshop/02firststeps/setupjira.html</guid><description>Set Up a JIRA Bug Tracking Project This task will involve integrating JIRA with FortiDevSec.
First, in a web browser, navigate to JIRA and log in to your account. Click the Projects dropdown, and click Create project.
Select the Software development project template.
Click Bug tracking.
Click Use template.
Create a name and key for your project, and click Create project.

It enables quick identification and ranking of vulnerabilities across a heterogenous codebase that may include application, infrastructure, and container code and third-party libraries. It provides insights in a consolodiated dashboard, and integrates seamlessly with JIRA issue-tracking software. Types of testing supported by FortiDevSec include SAST, SCA, Secrets, DAST, IaC, and container.</description></item></channel></rss>
