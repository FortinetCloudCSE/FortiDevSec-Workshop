### Running SAST Scans Locally (25 minutes)

In this section, you'll run a SAST scan on your forked AWS Goat repository. Before runnning the scan, however, you'll first configure FortiDevSec to integrate with JIRA. After the scan completes, you'll view the results both in the FortiDevSec and in JIRA, and understand how to sync ticket status updates from JIRA back to FortiDevSec.
