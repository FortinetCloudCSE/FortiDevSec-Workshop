### Application Setup and Launch (45 minutes)

In this section, you'll fork a GitHub repository popular for various cybersecurity scanning and demonstration activities. You'll clone it locally, and then get an introduction to the FortiDevSec console, where you'll configure an application associated with the repository. Afterwards, you'll set up a JIRA Bug-tracking project for integration with FortiDevSec. This will all be in preparation for the following sections, where you'll run actual SAST and DAST scans on the application from the command line and examine the results in the FortiDevSec, FortiDAST, and JIRA consoles as well.
